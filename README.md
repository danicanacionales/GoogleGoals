# Google Goals
One of the things on my impossible list is to work at Google as a Software Engineer. And of course, in order to achieve this goal, I have to improve my skill set. I found a Google Interview study plan on [Github](https://github.com/xiewenya/google-interview-university) and I'll be following this to start off my review.

These review notes are compiled from various sources which will be indicated with asterisk marks (*). The main companion I am using is the [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com) book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell and other sources over the internet. I do not take credit to any of their work. Some explanations may come from my personal understanding so, if any information is incorrect, please do let me know!
